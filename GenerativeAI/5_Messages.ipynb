       "\n",
       "### Explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **`QuantumCircuit(2, 2)`**: We start by creating a quantum circuit with two quantum bits (qubits) and two classical bits. The classical bits are where we'll store the results of our measurements.\n",
       "2.  **`bell_circuit.h(0)`**: The Hadamard gate (`h`) is applied to the first qubit (index `0`). This gate takes a qubit from a definite state (e.g., $|0\\rangle$) into a superposition of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. So, starting from $|00\\rangle$, we now have $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |10\\rangle)$.\n",
       "3.  **`bell_circuit.cx(0, 1)`**: The CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate is applied. Qubit `0` is the control, and qubit `1` is the target.\n",
       "    *   If the control qubit (`0`) is $|0\\rangle$, the target qubit (`1`) remains unchanged.\n",
       "    *   If the control qubit (`0`) is $|1\\rangle$, the target qubit (`1`) is flipped (NOT operation).\n",
       "    Applying this to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |10\\rangle)$ transforms it into $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$, which is our desired Bell state.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Verification:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Statevector Simulation:** This is the most direct way to confirm you've created the correct quantum state. The `AerSimulator(method='statevector')` allows you to retrieve the full quantum state vector. You'll see an output like `[0.707... 0. 0. 0.707...]`, where `0.707...` is approximately $1/\\sqrt{2}$. The indices correspond to the basis states $|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle$ respectively.\n",
       "*   **Measurement Simulation:** This simulates what you'd observe if you ran the circuit on a real quantum computer. By adding `bell_circuit.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])` and running many `shots`, you'll see the outcomes. For a Bell state, you should get roughly 50% of the results as `'00'` and 50% as `'11'`, with very few or no `'01'` or `'10'` results. This is the hallmark of entanglement in the computational basis.\n",
